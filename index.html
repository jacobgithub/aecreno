                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Lily Bear is a 6 year old female Mastiff that was rescued by Sugarland Ranch. She was treated at Animal Emergency Center for a very serious condition called Gastric Dilitation and Volvulus (GDV). This condition is also called Gastric Torsion, Stomach Bloat or often just simply Bloat.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        GDV is a life threatening condition that is most commonly seen in large, deep chested dogs. The exact cause of the condition is unknown. Dogs that are fed one large meal, "nervous" dogs, dogs with a family history of GDV and older dogs are at a higher risk of developing GDV. In a GDV the stomach twists around on itself which allows air to get into the stomach. The air becomes trapped and continues to build up, but cannot get out. The stomach becomes so distended with air that it leads to compression of the body's major blood vessels causing organ damage.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The symptoms of GDV include abdominal bloating, restlessness, non productive vomiting and retching. If a GDV is not treated quickly and aggressively dogs will go into shock and can die very quickly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Treatment for GDV includes treatment for shock, decompressing the stomach and then surgery. The goal of surgery is to reposition the stomach to it's normal position and then "tack" the stomach to the side of the body wall to prevent the stomach from twisting again. This is called a gastropexy. This procedure is ~95% successful in preventing a reoccurrence of GDV.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        GDV is such a serious disorder that even after surgery dogs are at a high risk of complications for several days. These complications include abnormal heart rhythms, blood clots and DIC. DIC is a very complicated syndrome where initially the body starts forming blood clots which leads to a consumption of the building blocks for clotting. Once these building blocks are used up, internal bleeding can occur.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is not a lot that can be done to prevent a GDV. Feeding several smaller meals a day and limiting exercise after eating should be done in large deep chested dogs. In high risk breeds with a family history of GDV a prophylactic gastropexy at an early age can be considered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fortunately for Lily Bear, her owner's recognized her symptoms early and she was taken immediately to Animal Emergency Center. Upon presentation an X-Ray was taken to confirm her condition. She was in the early stages of shock. Shock treatment was started immediately and she was given IV fluids and pain medication and then her stomach was decompressed. She was then taken to surgery. During surgery it was found that the blood vessels going to her spleen had torn and she had some internal bleeding. Her spleen also had to be removed. Her stomach was repositioned and then a gastropexy was performed to attach the right side of her stomach to the right side of the abdomen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because of her internal bleeding she required a blood transfusion post operatively. This is an uncommon complication of GDV. She was on IV fluids, pain medication, Oxygen and supportive care for 2 days after surgery. Lily Bear was treated both here at AEC as well as at her regular veterinarian, Baring Blvd during the day. She was able to be discharged on the third day and is now doing very well. To read more about Sugarland Ranch and please visit the

                "Tai" - Rattlesnake Bite
              </h4>


                    <p>
                        Tai is a 10 month old Labrador cross pup that was adopted from the Humane Society. He's a very good puppy, but he has a bad habit of sticking his nose in places it doesn't belong. One morning late this summer while on a hike, he stuck his nose in a bush that had a Rattlesnake in it and was bit on the tip of the nose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tai was taken immediately to the Animal Emergency Center and received treatment for his bite. He had blood tests to evaluate for complications of related to rattlesnake bites, such as blood clotting disorders. He was given IV fluids to prevent his blood pressure from dropping and pain medication because snake bites can be very painful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rattlesnake bites can be serious, especially in small dogs, cats and animals that get bit multiple times. The symptoms of Rattlesnake bites are - small puncture wounds that often ooze bloody fluid, rapid swelling around the bite, pain and in more severe cases shock. Fortunately, the Rattlesnakes in our area are less venomous than many Rattlesnake species and fatalities are rare. Rattlesnake bite patients should have blood testing to monitor for complications, blood pressure monitoring, IV fluids, pain medication and in some cases Antivenin. Because of the cost and potential side effects of Antivenin, it's use is generally reserved for small dogs, dogs that have received multiple bites, and/or dogs that are showing signs of shock. Antibiotics are also sometimes used, though some studies show that the actual incidence of infection after a snake bite is very low.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tai responded well to treatment and was able to go home the next morning. It took 3 day's for to resolve completely.
                    </p>

                        The photos below show Tai before he was bitten and a photo taken 24 hours after he had been bitten.

                            We have a state of the art Digital X-Ray Machine. Digital radiographs have revolutionized veterinary radiology by increasing the speed in which x-rays can be obtained and by providing better quality images. Another advantage of Digital Radiographs is that we can easily send in our x-rays for a Board Certified Radiologist to review increasing the quality of x-ray interpretation.

                        Dealing with money is the most difficult part of our jobs. We all became veterinarians to help animals but, because we are a business without any government funding all costs must be paid at the time of service. We do take all major credit cards, personal checks and cash. We also take the CareCredit credit card.

                        CareCredit is a personal line of credit for healthcare treatments and procedures for your entire family, including your pets. It works like a credit card but it has two advantages. It can only be used for healthcare services and you can get No Interest financing every time you use it. Simply pay your minimum monthly payment and pay off the entire balance by the end of your promotional period and you pay No Interest. If you need more time to pay for your procedure, you can take advantage of CareCredit's extended payment plans with low, fixed interest rates.

                        The cost to treat your pet is highly variable, depending on the severity of your pets illness. We will give you an estimate when you bring your pet in, but due to the nature of medicine it can be impossible to give an accurate estimate at that time. We will try and keep every client informed about the costs involved at all times.

                        We are a state of the art veterinary emergency clinic. Much of our equipment is the same that many human hospitals have. We are fully staffed with at least one veterinarian and multiple veterinary techicians at all times during our business hours. Even so the cost to treat a pet is far less than to treat a person and in many cases similar to the costs at a day time veterinary practice.

                        In many cases we do allow people to visit their pet. At times though this can cause more harm than good since some pets get excited when they see their owner and then can become depressed after their owner leaves. Please talk to the veterinarian treating your pet to discuss visitation.

                        All follow up care should be done with your regular day time veterinarian. We fax the record of every patient to their regular veterinarian so that all the needed information is available to them.

                            <li>
                                Vaccinate your pet. Puppies and Kittens should start vaccinations at 6 to 8 weeks of age. Then boostered every 3 to 4 weeks until 20 weeks of age.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Spay or Neuter your pet. This will help keep your pet from roaming, help prevent unwanted behavior, prevent certain types of cancer and prevent uterine and prostate infections.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Monitor your pets' diet. Abrupt changes in diet, table scraps, garbage can cause stomach upset.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Keep poisons out of the reach of your pet. Rat poison and antifreeze are two of the more common pet poisonings we see.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Keep ALL medications out of the reach of your pet. Another common toxicity we see are pets that have ingested their owners', their own or another pets' medication. Chewable medications are flavored and many pets will seek these out as treats.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Don't give your pet medication unless prescribed by your veterinarian. Advil, Tylenol and many other medications can be toxic to pets.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Obedience training and exercise make for a happy, well adjusted pet.
